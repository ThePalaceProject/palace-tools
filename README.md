## Working as a developer on this project

### pyenv

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It can be
[installed](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) using the command `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`. You can then
install the version of Python you want to work with.

It is recommended that [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) be used to allow `pyenv`
to manage _virtual environments_ in a manner that can be used by the [poetry](#poetry) tool. The `pyenv-virtualenv`
plugin can be installed by cloning the relevant repository into the `plugins` subdirectory of your `$PYENV_ROOT`:

```sh
mkdir -p $PYENV_ROOT/plugins
cd $PYENV_ROOT/plugins
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv
```

After cloning the repository, `pyenv` now has a new `virtualenv` command:

```sh
$ pyenv virtualenv
pyenv-virtualenv: no virtualenv name given.
```

### Poetry

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
If you plan to work on this project, you will need `poetry`.

Poetry can be installed using the command `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`.

More information about installation options can be found in the
[poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation).

## Installation

This package is not currently available oon PyPI, but it can be installed and run locally in a couple of
different ways, depending on your needs.

### Installing the CLI Tools globally with `pipx`

Installing with `pipx` will be most conducive to running the CLI Tools from any directory.

If you don't already have `pipx` installed, you can get installation instructions
[here](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#install-pipx).

```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/tdilauro/palace-client-utils.git
```

or, if you wish to install a particular branch or commit, you can do something like this
(more details about [installing from VCS here](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-from-source-control)):

```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/tdilauro/palace-client-utils.git@branch-or-commit
```

If installation is successful, `pipx` will list the apps that are installed with the package.

### Running CLI Tools from a cloned project

- Clone the repository.
- Change into the cloned directory.
- Run `pyenv virtualenv <python-version> <virtualenv-name>` to create a Python virtual environment.
- Run `pyenv local <virtualenv-name>` to use that virtual environment whenever in the cloned directory.
- Run `poetry install` to install the project dependencies and the CLI tools into the virtual environment.

At this point, you should be able to run the CLI tools using `poetry run <cli-command-and-args>`.
